# ACO-NN Weights Optimizer for Financial Risk Prediction  

**Optimizing neural network weights using Ant Colony Algorithm for improved financial risk forecasting.**  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository implements an **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**-based approach to optimize neural network (NN) weights, enhancing prediction accuracy in financial risk modeling. Traditional gradient-based methods can get stuck in local optima, while ACO's metaheuristic search efficiently explores the weight space for better solutions.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for NN weight training.  
- **Customizable neural network architecture** (layers, activation functions).  
- **Benchmarking against traditional optimizers** (SGD, Adam).  
- **Financial risk prediction use case** (credit risk, market volatility, etc.).  
- **Modular & scalable design** for easy experimentation.  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- Improved convergence and generalization compared to backpropagation.  
- Better handling of noisy financial datasets.  
- Adaptive exploration-exploitation balance via pheromone updates.  

## ðŸ›  Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ACO-NN-Financial-Risk-Prediction.git
cd ACO-NN-Financial-Risk-Prediction
